# Would You Rather Project Description

This project showcases my understanding of React, ES6, and Redux.

In the "Would You Rather?" user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”.

## Installing Dependencies

If you are using Yarn, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Otherwise, if you are using NPM:

```
npm install
```

## Running The App

If you are using Yarn, run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

Otherwise, if you are using NPM:

```
npm start
```

Either of those runs the app in the development mode. You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
